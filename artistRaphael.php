                <p><i><strong>Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino</strong> known as <strong>Raphael</strong> , was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance.</i></p>
<p><i>His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. </i></p>
<p><i>Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.</i></p>
<p><i>Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his death at 37, leaving a large body of work. Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career.	</i></p>
