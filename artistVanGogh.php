                "<p><i><strong>	Vincent Willem van Gogh</strong>(30 March 1853 - 29 July 1890) was a Dutchpost-Impressionist painter whose work had far-reaching influence on 20th-century art.</i></p>
<p><i>His paintings include portraits, self portraits, landscapes, still lifes, olive trees and cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers. He was largely ignored by critics until after his early death in 1890. </i></p>
<p><i>The only substantial exhibitions held during his lifetime were showcases in Paris and Brussels. The first published full-length article came in 1890, when Albert Aurier described him as a Symbolist. </i></p>
<p><i>The widespread and popular realisation of his significance in the history of modern art did not begin until his adoption by the Fauves and German Expressionists in the mid-1910s.	</i></p>
