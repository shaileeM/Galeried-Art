                <p><i><strong>	Pablo Ruiz y Picasso</strong>, also known as <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong>(25 October 1881 - 8 April 1973),was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, stage designer, poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France. </i></p>
<p><i>Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. </i></p>
        <p><i>During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. </i></p>
<p><i>His work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901-1904), the Rose Period (1904-1906), theAfrican-influenced Period (1907-1909), Analytic Cubism (1909-1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912-1919), also referred to as the Crystal period.</i></p>
